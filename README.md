In this project, I developed an engaging memory game featuring a random sequence of four distinct colors. Players aimed to replicate this sequence accurately.

To ensure a seamless gaming experience, I divided the game into two phases. The first phase focused on generating the color sequence, aiming for a balance of challenge and enjoyment. The second phase involved checking user input to confirm it matched the generated sequence.

The user interface was designed for user-friendliness, with visual cues aiding players in remembering the colors. These cues enhanced accessibility for a wide audience.
